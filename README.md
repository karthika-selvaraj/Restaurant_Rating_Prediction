# Restaurant_Rating_Prediction
- This restaurant rating prediction model is created based on predictive analysis which means it will predict rating of restaurant using some features like reviews, votes, cuisines, table booking option and etc.
- The objective is, suppose we wish to eat our favourite dish in a restaurant but we don't know which restaurant will provide good and deliciuos food. At that time we will do some random searches in google to find good restaurant and we mainly focus on their ratings and reviews. 
- Then, which restaurant having higher rating and good reviews from their customers, finally we select that restaurant to have our food. This model will do the same thing such that it will predict rating of a restaurant.
